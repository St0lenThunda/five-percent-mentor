# How to Eat to Live: An Overview

The teachings on health and diet in the Nation of Gods and Earths are primarily based on the instructions of **Elijah Muhammad** in his seminal work, *How to Eat to Live*. These principles are seen as essential for maintaining the "Seven" (the God-mind) in a physical temple that is clean and strong.

## Core Dietary Principles

### 1. The One-Meal-A-Day Rule
Elijah Muhammad emphasized that eating once every 24 hours (and eventually once every 48 or 72 hours) is the key to longevity and mental clarity. This allows the digestive system to rest and the body to focus on repair rather than constant digestion.

### 2. Forbidden Foods
Strict adherence to dietary laws is required to maintain purity:
- **No Swine (Pork)**: Viewed as the most "unclean" animal, unfit for human consumption.
- **No Scavengers**: Avoiding bottom-feeders like certain shellfish.
- **Limited Starches**: Reducing heavy breads and white flours.

### 3. Pure Staples
- **Navy Beans**: Cited as the best food for the original man.
- **Whole Wheat**: Replacing processed grains.
- **Fresh Fruits & Vegetables**: Simple, natural foods are preferred.

## The Mental Connection
The physical body is the foundation for the mind. If the temple is cluttered with "garbage," the mind cannot reach the frequency of **Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding**.
