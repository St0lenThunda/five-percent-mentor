# The 120 Lessons: An Overview

The **120 Lessons**, also known as the **Book of Life**, are the foundational curriculum of the Nation of Gods and Earths. They consist of three main sets of lessons that were originally developed from the teachings of the Nation of Islam, but were interpreted and expanded upon by **Allah the Father** (Clarence 13X).

## Core Components

### 1. Student Enrollment (1-10)
Ten questions and answers that establish the identity of the original people and the reality of the world. Key questions include "Who is the Original Man?" and "Who is the 5% in the world?"

### 2. Lost-Found Muslim Lessons No. 1 & 2
These lessons dive deeper into history, mathematics, and the nature of the "trickster" or the "85%". They emphasize the science of everything in life through numerical and logical proof.

### 3. English Lesson No. C1
Advanced symbolic and numerical teachings that refine the understanding of the previous lessons.

## Practical Application
For a Five Percenter, the lessons are not just for memorization; they are for **comprehension** and **application**.
1. **Knowledge (1)**: Study the letter.
2. **Wisdom (2)**: Apply the meaning in your actions.
3. **Understanding (3)**: Manifest the clear picture in your life.
