# Knowledge of Self: Key Takeaways

**Knowledge of Self** is a concept central to the Nation of Gods and Earths. It refers to the understanding of one's true nature, history, and the potential of the human mind.

## What is Knowledge of Self?
It is the realization that the Black man is the "Original Man," the architect and owner of the universe. It is the understanding that the Black woman is the "Earth," the educator and life-giver. This knowledge removes the mental shackles placed by a society built on historical misinformation.

## Core Principles
1. **Self-Realization**: Understanding your divine nature and rejecting assigned identities from external systems.
2. **Mental Freedom**: Freeing the mind from "spooks" and religious myths that keep the original man in a state of dependency.
3. **Culture as a Way of Life**: Living according to the laws of nature and the Supreme Mathematics.

## The Science of Everything
Everything in life is tied to mathematics. By knowing yourself, you learn how to calculate your way through any situation. You become the master of your own destiny (Lord and Master of your own Cipher).

## Quote
*"Knowledge is the foundation of all things. Wisdom is the application. Understanding is the clear picture. To know yourself is to know God."*
